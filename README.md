# ChessMate Android Application
ChessMate is a one player chess engine where the user plays against an AI opponent. 
Not only can the player play a game of chess, they can save their games to replay for analysis and pause games in the middle of playing. 
The majority of the processing is done on the ARM chip on the DE1-SoC with rendering and move input being done on an Android phone. The DE1 and the phone are supposed to communicate over Bluetooth.
